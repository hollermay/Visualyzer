# Algorithm Visualizer

## Overview

**Algorithm Visualizer** is a web-based tool built using **Next.js** and **TypeScript** that provides interactive visualizations of various algorithms. This tool is designed to help students, educators, and enthusiasts understand the inner workings of algorithms by providing step-by-step visual representations.

### Current Features

- **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: Visualize the shortest path in a weighted graph.
- **Preorder Tree Traversal**: Explore the traversal of a binary tree in preorder (root, left, right).
- **Postorder Tree Traversal**: Explore the traversal of a binary tree in postorder (left, right, root).
- **Floyd-Warshall Algorithm**: Visualize the all-pairs shortest path in a weighted graph.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js, TypeScript
- **Styling**: css
- **Visualization**: 

## Installation

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

4. **Open the application**:
    Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

1. Select an algorithm from the available list.
2. Input the required data, such as graph nodes, edges, or tree structures.
3. Click on "Visualize" to see the algorithm in action.
4. Follow along with the visualization to understand each step of the algorithm.
